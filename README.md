Super Quadratic Funding
==================

# Usage

With Superfluid we were able to integrate 2 very useful Usecases.
We wanted to give people the possibility to choose which charity and which organisation gets what funding.
First, we have philanthropists who donate large sums of money to a good cause. They stream their donation to our DAO.
They do not know which charity is the best and most promising.
Because of that, we use the knowledge of people.
We as donators can pick which charity gets how much funding.
We are able to do this with quadratic funding.


We programmed a SuperApp which uses the Constant FlowAgreement and Instant distribution agreement.
Donators can choose a charity to donate to, and subscribe to them for weekly donations, with a constant flow agreement.
The SuperApp will create a stream to the charity from the user.
The voting power will be decided by the flow rate to a given charity and the number of people who are donating to it.
This is calculated with quadratic funding to fairly distribute funds to public goods.


After a period, let's say 1 week, the funds that were collected by the DAO will be distributed with agreement.
The units represent the voting power and were updated continuously.
The charities will get accumulated funds from the stream of philanthropists, depending on the quadratic funding.

Now, the charity gets a constant stream of donations PLUS the weekly distribution of the funds from the philanthropists.


The opportunity for this technology for others is to distribute funds under a DAO to support public goods ,
like developing the ecosystem of the dao.
The users of the ecosystem will decide by their donations, and projects that are well needed will be funded.
